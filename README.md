# About Tests (scenarios created)
Here in this repository you will find a project I created using __Java8__ as main language, __Maven__ to manage dependencies, __Junit__ framework to create each request of the challenge as a test, __Selenium-WebDriver__ framework to manipulate my tests and using some resources.
